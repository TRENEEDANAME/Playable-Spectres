This is the github repository of the **mod project** folder for my [Playable Spectres](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2826984284). 
This will be the most up to date project folder from the mod, even before it's on steam.

## How to build the mod

- The Modbuddy SDK (Search in the steam's tool sections)

- Start the SDK, go in file then "open mod project" (you will need to extract the project's folder).
- Then do your changes

## FAQ

### Why not post the "ready to use" version of the mod ?
Because it allows you to change the source code and compile the mod as you see fit. If enough people ask, I will release the proper mod to github as well.

### Can I do pull requests ?
**YES**, you can, you can open issues, pull request, discussions...

### Can I fork it ?
Yes you can, just credit the original author [Gazgemauch(https://www.nexusmods.com/xcom2/users/71160223) and me
